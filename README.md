## About the Project

This project is a front-end project i completed at Northcoders Bootcamp. It is a responsive board game review website that uses an api i created as part of my backend project on the course.  Users can login, view reviews, sort reviews, like or dislike the reviews, comment or remove their own comments, and submit their own reviews.
